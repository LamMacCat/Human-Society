Hello there, my name is Guo Kaicheng, and I graduated from an international school in Beijing with a GPA of 3.88 out of 4. Now I'm planning to study at Purdue University, a top university in America. During high school, I studied multiple college-level courses and participated in many activities. Those experiences have fostered my skills.

For example, I served as a teaching assistant in my 10th-grade English class. My job was to correct grammatical errors in my classmates' essays. I was also responsible for giving feedback to my teacher. This experience helped me gain communication and teaching skills.
